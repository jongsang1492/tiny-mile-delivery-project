Contactless delivery mechanism redesign for Tiny Mile robot (UofT 1st year design course)

# Tiny Mile Contactless Delivery Project 

This project was completed as part of a client-based engineering design course (APS112/113) at the University of Toronto. **Tiny Mile**, is the client of the Home Food Delivery Project that operates small remote-controlled delivery robots in urban environments. Our team's objective was to redesign the unloading system of their robot "Geoffrey" to support contactless delivery in complex, real-world conditions.

## Project Overview
- Focused on reducing human interaction during the COVID-19 pandemic
- Designed for safe drop-off on benches, stairs, ledges, and various terrain
- Considered urban constraints such as weather, pedestrians, and municipal laws

## My Contributions
- Defined system functions using Black Box and Enumeration methods
- Drafted primary and secondary functions based on stakeholder needs:
  - Primary: Contactless placement of food
  - Secondary: Spill-proof transport, thermal insulation, drop-off confirmation
- Conducted environmental & stakeholder analysis
- Participated in evaluation of three alternative designs
- Finalized and documented the selected unloading mechanism: **Squat and Place**

## Design Decision
- Generated initial sketches of three concepts
- Evaluated alternatives with a Pugh Chart
- Selected "Squat and Place" as final concept for its reliability and humanlike motion
